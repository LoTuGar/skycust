This is a greasemonkey userscript (that runs on Chrome as well, natively, and possibly other browsers as well).

It requests a canonical source for avatar replacements for people on a specific phpBB forum.

It has a hardcoded list of servers to try in order for images and a hardcoded phpBB forum to replace images on. It is intended to be used with the game "Skyrates", at forum.skyrates.net.
