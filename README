This is an (unpacked) Chrome extension, ready for building. This is necessary as Chrome userscripts don't support @require or cross-domain xhr.

This requests avatar replacements for people on a forum.

It has a user-editable list of servers to try in order for images and a hardcoded forum to replace images on. It is intended to be used with the game "Skyrates", at forum.skyrates.net, but that's not a fundamental limitation of the code.

NOTE: skycust.user.js is /not/ a greasemonkey userscript. If you're looking for that, see the master branch.
