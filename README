This is an (unpacked) Chrome extension, ready for building. This is necessary as Chrome userscripts don't support @require or cross-domain xhr.

It requests a canonical source for avatar replacements for people on a specific phpBB forum.

It has a hardcoded list of servers to try in order for images and a hardcoded phpBB forum to replace images on. It is intended to be used with the game "Skyrates", at forum.skyrates.net.

NOTE: skycust.user.js is /not/ a greasemonkey userscript. If you're looking for that, see the master branch.
